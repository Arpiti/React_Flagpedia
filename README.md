# React_Flagpedia

This project has a simple use of javascript objects, react Hook userState, basic HTML components and css styling.
Basically, there is a input field where you can put any country name from our Database and then the program will give you the corresponding flag as sitethe result.
You can see the existing database in the footer section of the website. 

You can even click on any of the flag to get it's name in the result.
 The program works both ways.
 
 Enjoy !
